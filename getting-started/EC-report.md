# Extra Credit - Reports

Each HW assignment this semester will require you to write an accompanying report. Students in CS 532 must use LaTeX to write reports, as it is the markup language for academic publications.  Students in CS 432 may use either LaTeX or Markdown, a lightweight markup language that is often used in GitHub.

## Instructions

First, read the information provided in [Writing HW Reports](reports.md). This includes links to templates and an example report from a previous semester. 

If you are in CS 532, you should complete the **CS 532 (LaTeX and Overleaf)** section.  If you are in CS 432, you may complete either section - based on which tool you're likely to use for completing your reports.

### CS 432 (Markdown)

In your GitHub class repo, create a new Markdown file named `EC0-report.md` and copy the content from [CS432-report-template.md](CS432-report-template.md) into it.

Modify the content to include your name, EC 0.6 - Reports, and the due date for this exercise.

Upload an image to your GitHub repo and include it in place of the "Growth of the Early Web" image. Make sure to change the description of the image in the report, too.

Replace the code in the fenced code block with another block of code.  You can use some Python code, or you can insert code from a different language -- just change the language indicated so that syntax highlighting still works properly.

Edit the first table so that it matches the first 4 weeks of our class schedule, as given in our [syllabus](https://github.com/odu-cs432-websci/public-spr24/blob/main/syllabus.md#summary-schedule).

In the References section, replace the placeholder references with three webpages that you've visited so far this semester related to the class. These should include both the title of the webpage/article and the URL.

Finally, make sure that your remote GitHub assignment repo contains the final version of your edited report file (`EC0-report.md`) and your included image.  

### CS 532 (LaTeX and Overleaf)

For students in CS 532, reports must be written in LaTeX and compiled into a PDF document.  

[Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) provides an online setup for writing and compiling LaTeX into PDF.  You will need to sign up for a free [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) account.

Copy the "CS532 - report template" project into your Overleaf account and rename it "EC0-report".

Modify the report to include your name, EC 0.6 - Reports, and the due date for this exercise.

Upload an image to your GitHub repo and include it in place of the "Growth of the Early Web" image. Make sure to change the image caption and description of the image in the report, too.

Replace the code in the `lstlisting` environment with another block of code.  You can use some Python code, or you can insert code from a different language -- just change the language indicated so that syntax highlighting still works properly.  Make sure to change the caption as needed.

Edit Table 1 so that it matches the first 4 weeks of our class schedule, as given in our [syllabus](https://github.com/odu-cs432-websci/public-spr24/blob/main/syllabus.md#summary-schedule).

In the References section, replace the placeholder references with three webpages that you've visited so far this semester related to the class. These should include both the title of the webpage/article and the URL.

Finally, make sure that your remote GitHub assignment repo contains your generated PDF, source LaTeX, and images needed to generate your report.
