# Extra Credit - MemGator

We will be using [MemGator](https://github.com/oduwsdl/MemGator) to examine the contents of public web archives. This task will get you set up with a local instance of MemGator so that you will be prepared for a later HW assignment.

## Instructions

Download and install a local version of MemGator:

* Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/oduwsdl/MemGator/releases) in the repository
* Scroll down to the "Assets" section.  Click the triangle icon to expand the list.  Choose the executable that matches your OS.
  * -darwin is for MacOS
  * -386 is for 32-bit architectures (older machines)
  * -amd64 is for 64-bit architectures (newer machines)

Memgator is a command-line tool, so you will need to run it from Terminal (for MacOS) or PowerShell (for Windows).  You may need to set the permissions to executable before it will run.

* MacOS: If you get a security pop-up the first time you run it, open Finder to where you've installed it.  Right-click on memgator and choose Open.  Then you'll be able to select 'Open' from the pop-up.  Once you've done that, you'll be able to run it from the command line.

Test out your installation of memgator with the following example.  

```bash
$ ./memgator-darwin-amd64 -c "ODU CS432/532 YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"  -a https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odu-cs432-websci/public/main/archives.json -F 2 -f JSON https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/ > mweigle-tm.jsonon
```

Notes:
* `$` is the command line prompt (don't type that in)
* Replace `./memgator-darwin-amd64` with the appropriate executable for your system
* You must use the `-c` option to specify your contact information.  Replace `YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS` in the line above with your ODU email address.
* The [archives.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odu-cs432-websci/public/main/archives.json) configuration file specifies the public web archives that MemGator will contact. We cannot use the default file, so you **must** add `-a https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odu-cs432-websci/public/main/archives.json` to the command-line when you run MemGator.

The result in `mweigle-tm.json` should be similar to what you see below.  
```bash
$ head mweigle-tm.json
{
  "original_uri": "https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/",
  "self": "http://localhost:1208/timemap/json/https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/",
  "mementos": {
    "list": [
      {
        "datetime": "2006-08-30T23:22:00Z",
        "uri": "https://web.archive.org/web/20060830232200/http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/"
      },
      {
        ...
```

## Question

What do the `-F 2` and `-f JSON` options do?
