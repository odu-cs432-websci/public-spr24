# Extra Credit - Git, GitHub

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code, used in the popular [GitHub](https://github.com/) code hosting platform.

## Instructions

If you are not familiar with Git or GitHub, you should read over and walk through some of the following tutorials:

* "Hello World" at GitHub.com, https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
* Using Git source control in VS Code, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview
* Introduction to Git in VS Code, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git
* Introduction to GitHub in Visual Studio Code, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github-visual-studio-code/
* For a quick reference guide for git commands, see [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

For this class, you will only need basic Git/GitHub knowledge. To demonstrate this, perform the following tasks:

* create a new public repo in your account at GitHub.com
* add two files that can contain anything you want
* clone the repo locally (on your local machine)
* make and commit changes to one of the files in the repo locally
* push the changes back to GitHub
* open the repo in your web browser at GitHub.com
* make and commit changes to the other file in the repo on GitHub.com
* pull changes back to your local machine

## Questions

Submit answers to the following questions:

1. What is the URL of the new GitHub repo that you created in your personal account?

1. What changes did you make to the file?  Provide the URL to the commit that shows the changes.  (For example, here's a commit showing a text edit on a Markdown page, <https://github.com/odu-cs432-websci/public/commit/f14d9032806fb5b07ccea7cd4c0faca93283ad44>.) 

1. In which direction does the 'pull' command work (does it send local changes to remote OR send remote changes to local)?

1. If you have committed a change on your local machine, but do not see the update on GitHub.com, what step might have you forgotten?
