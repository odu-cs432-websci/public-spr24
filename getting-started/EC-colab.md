# Extra Credit - Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a project to host Python-based [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in the cloud. We'll look at many of our Python (and R) examples using this service. For more information about Google Colab, see their [FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).

## Instructions

* Make sure you're logged into a Google account (either a personal one or your ODU student account).
* Open [Overview of Colaboratory Features](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). Walk through and execute the examples shown. Experiment with changing some of the code and re-execute the cells.  Below each cell you edit, create a new Text cell that indicates you made an edit.  You can describe what you changed or even just write "EDIT MADE HERE".
* Create a new Code cell in the notebook and copy in and execute one of the "Python Strings" examples from [Python examples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_examples.asp).
* File > Save a copy in Drive. In the Google Drive document that opens, click on Share, then click "Change to anyone with the link", then click "Copy link" and submit that link.
