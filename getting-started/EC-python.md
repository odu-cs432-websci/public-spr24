# Extra Credit - Python

For this task you can use Python 3 on the ODU-CS Linux machines (use /usr/bin/python3 and not /usr/bin/python) or you can [download it](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run on your local machine. Review some of the [important differences between Python 2.7 and Python 3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/important-differences-between-python-2-x-and-python-3-x-with-examples/).

## Instructions

* Pick one of the "Python Strings" examples from [Python examples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_examples.asp), save it to a file (either in your ODU-CS folder that you created in [EC - ODU-CS Linux](EC-linux.md) or on your local machine), and execute it using Python 3.
* Submit your source code and a screenshot of the command you used to run it and its output.
  
For an additional point of extra credit, complete the task from [EC - Programming](EC-program.md) using Python.  Submit source code and output for the task in addition to the above files.

## Resources

You may do some of your work on your local machine with an IDE. There are several different IDEs you can use for programming in Python, but I've gotten to really like [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). In addition to extensions for Python, it can also connect with GitHub repositories and preview Markdown (both of which will be described in later exercises). Here are some helpful links for getting setup with VS Code:

* [Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
* [Working with GitHub in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github), [GitHub and VS Code](https://vscode.github.com/)
* [Markdown and VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)
