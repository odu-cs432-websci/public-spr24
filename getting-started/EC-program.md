# Extra Credit - Programming Task

This is a example of a programming task that we'll be doing this semester.  For this task, you may use any programming language you're comfortable with (but going forward, we'll be using Python).  

**Important:** *If you have trouble completing this task, you should reconsider taking this course. Although this course covers Python syntax, it assumes that you have previous programming experience and can pick up the new syntax quickly. This is **not** a course that teaches how to program.*

## Instructions

* Download the file, [friend-count.csv](friend-count.csv).  This is a comma-separated file containing a list of users and their number of friends.
* Write a program that reads in the file, groups the users by the first letter in the user's name, and prints the number of users and total number of friends for each first letter.  Example below:
```
   A - 7 users, 2141 total friends
   B - 2 users, 733 total friends
   ...
```
* Submit your program source code and either a screenshot of your full output or a file that contains your output (write to the file from your program or copy/paste the output into a text file).
